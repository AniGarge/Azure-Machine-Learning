# Azure-Machine-Learning

#### Using Python SDK to develop compute instances and experiments to train a regularized Ridge Classifier for diabetes dataset and running it on Azure Machine Learning Studio. Code is developed on local machine but it runs on the workspace created on cloud. Finally output the best model and register it on the cloud.

#### Also made use of compute targets to develop a Logistic Regression Model to classify handwritten digits. Generate an Azure Machine Learning Compute Target in the workspace and using remote clusters for training purpose and finding out the optimal model.
