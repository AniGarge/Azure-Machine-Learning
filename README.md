# Azure-Machine-Learning

#### Projects in this repository demonstrate how to use cloud resources and architecture in data science and analytics. Also, the projects show how the code is developed on a local machine but is run on the compute target and instances on the cloud. We just need a platform to build code and every resource used is that of the cloud.

#### Using Python SDK to develop compute instances and experiments to train a regularized Ridge Classifier for diabetes dataset and deploying it on Azure Machine Learning Studio. Code is developed on local machine but it runs on the workspace created on cloud. Finally output the best model according to the performance metrics and register it on the cloud for further predictions.

#### Also made use of compute targets to develop a Logistic Regression Model to classify handwritten digits. Generate an Azure Machine Learning Compute Target in the workspace and using remote clusters for training purpose and finding out the optimal model.
